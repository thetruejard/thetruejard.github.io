    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <img class="leftimg" src="/projects/salamanderdance/bruni_reference.jpg">
    <p>This was my first large animation project. It started with an inexplicable motivation to recreate the character Bruni, the fire spirit from Disney's <cite>Frozen 2</cite> (pictured left). I originally only planned to make a short 10-15s test video, but before I knew it I had over a minute of animation.</p>
    <p>Bruni's character model was made from scratch, rigged by hand, and procedurally textured. The set/location was also made by hand and uses CC0-licensed textures. The animation took about 500 hours to render on a GTX 1060 (laptop.)</p>
    <p>The leaves were animated using Blender's old particle physics system. They suffer from many artifacts that were likely avoidable but beyond my reach at the time. Nowadays I would approach them very differently.</p>
