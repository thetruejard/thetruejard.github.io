    <p>This was my final project for Stanford CS 348C: Computer Graphics: Animation and Simulation, winter 2024. I used a mixture of Blender and Houdini Apprentice. Interop was difficult (Houdini App. doesn't allow exporting many formats), so I had to use compositing effects to put the trees. Overall I thought it turned out well, but the skimpiness of the simulated trees was a bit disappointing. I hope to someday recreate this premise with more effort when I have the time.</p>
