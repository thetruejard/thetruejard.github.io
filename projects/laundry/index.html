    <h2>Animated Short Film Project</h2>
    <img class="leftimg" src="/projects/laundry/source_material.jpg">
    <p>"Laundry" is a WIP 6-minute animated short film inspired by the post-apocalyptic <i>iyashikei</i> series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girls%27_Last_Tour" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><cite>Girls' Last Tour</cite></a> by author Tsukumizu. The series features Chito and Yuuri, two girls who are left to fend for themselves as they nagivate the ruins of a long-collapsed civilization. </p>
    <p>In this short film, Chito stumbles across a clean source of water and takes advantage of the opportunity to do their laundry, only to find an unexpected surprise floating nearby.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this project is to expand my skills as a 3D artist and animator, familiarize myself with new technologies I haven't used before (including tools for animation, simulation, and graphics programming), and create a cinematic visual story that I can be proud of.</p>
    <p>Overall, the goals of the project include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Rigged character models including multiple outfits and curve-based hair</li>
        <li>Post-apocalyptic scenes utilizing custom procedural tools</li>
        <li>Original soundtrack inspired by the works of Kenichiro Suehiro and Kevin Penkin</li>
        <li>All assets (textures, etc.) are CC0-licensed or made by hand without the use of generative AI</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Chito</h2>
    <img class="leftimg" loading="lazy" src="/projects/laundry/chito_main.png">
    <p>Chito is the main character of this animation. She's the rational and level-headed one in the duo, oftening handling navigation and vehicle maintenance, and enjoys collecting books.</p>
    <p>I made Chito's character model from scratch, trying my best to adapt her original <i>chibi</i> art style to a 3D format. I followed all steps of a typical character creation pipeline, including sculting, retopology, rigging, and UV unwrapping/texturing. Her skin and eye textures are fully procedural, and her hair, eyelashes, and eyebrows are all curve-based.</p>

    <h2>Yuuri</h2>
    <img class="leftimg" loading="lazy" src="/projects/laundry/yuuri_main.png">
    <p>Yuuri is the other main character of the original series, but plays a minor role in this animation. Her and Chito's relationship is unclear, but they're companions who stick together through thick and thin.</p>
    <p>Yuuri's character model is based largely on Chito's. I only significantly changed her eyes, jacket, helmet, and hair. She has some very minor UV artifacts on her jacket which I decided were unimportant, but I may elect to fix them sometime.</p>

    <h2>Kettenkrad</h2>
    <p>Chito and Yuuri travel in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sd.Kfz._2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sd.Kfz.2 / Kleines Kettenkraftrad HK 101</a>, or "Kettenkrad," originally from 1930s-40s Germany. Apparently the author is a fan of <cite>Saving Private Ryan</cite>, which featured the same vehicle.</p>
    <p>I made this model virtually from scratch, using only CC0 PBR textures as a base for the materials. All modeling and rigging is my original work, and the textures were manually painted onto the model.</p>

    <h2>Scene</h2>
    <img class="leftimg" loading="lazy" src="/projects/laundry/source_scene.jpg">
    <p>The animation takes place at a large facility with unknown purpose, potentially water treatment or processing. The building, which I call the "Outlet," features massive drain pipes that funnel snowmelt runoff onto a wide open platform.</p>
    <p>Currently, only the main area is complete, and I've deferred background details until I've finished the animation (so I can judge which areas are most important.) In the final animation, there will be many more buildings and superstructures in the distant background.</p>
