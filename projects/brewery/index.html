    <p>A proprietary animated logo commissioned for a startup brewery. Rights to this animation go to the brewery itself.</p>
    <p>This animation was made from scratch based on one reference drawing. The fluid simulation was very difficult to control; I changed solvers partway through, hid invisible obstacles, and and ran dozens of simulations until it behaved as I wanted.</p>
